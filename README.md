# Make-A-Drink
_For Android_

#### Intro:
MAD or _(Make-A-Drink)_ is going to be a series of various applications aimed towards one goal: Providing projects for me to do for the 100 Days of Code. The by-product of the series is however learning about a bunch of new Cocktails! This series is meant for me to gain a better understanding of Android standalone application development.

To summerize the actual application: the series will be aimed to make an Android Application that will provide a list of drinks _(cocktails)_. Which will also provide info on how to make the drink. **DISCLAIMER:** THERE'S A MILLION-AND-ONE apps like this one. So the idea isn't new.
#### Umm.. There's a better way:
I will be the first to say that this isn't the best implementation. My original idea of the best approach to the solution was much better. Standalone applications are dated and not as refined as some other implementations. Later on when my schedule is better I'll be doing my other method. Hence why this is the _MAD_ series. Because this is the crazy lazy aproach.

#### _Dedicated To:_
This series is dedicated to my current friend who is learning to be a Bar Tender.
